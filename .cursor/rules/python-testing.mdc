# Python Tests

## When to write new tests, new test cases, or update existing test cases
When adding features, fixing bugs, or making any changes, write automated tests with PyTest that logically covers the change. Run tests to verify they pass using `uv run pytest`.

A bug is not fixed until a test prove that it's fixed, that would have failed without fixing the bug.
