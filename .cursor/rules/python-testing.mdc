# Python Testing Requirements
**Applies to:** Python files (*.py)

## ALWAYS Write Tests
When adding features, fixing bugs, or making changes:
- You MUST write automated tests with PyTest
- Tests MUST logically cover the changes made
- Run tests using `uv run pytest` to verify they pass

## Bug Fixing Rule
A bug is **NOT FIXED** until a test proves it's fixed that would have failed before the fix.
