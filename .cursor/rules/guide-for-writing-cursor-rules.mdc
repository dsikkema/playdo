# Writing Cursor Rules
- Provide examples of what to do and not do
- Explain motivations why: this helps the AI pay attention to the rule and better understand its applicability
- Provide remarks about when the rule is applicable
- If there are specific circumstances in which it's not applicable, list those
- Use a highly structured format
- Make rules concise and to the point: they will be forgotten if too wordy
- It is MANDATORY that you MUST be verbally clear about things that are important. Use terms like "NEVER do this" and "this is REQUIRED". This helps the AI pay
  attention to the important parts: the AI notices clear, attention-grabbing language.
