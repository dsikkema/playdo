Please help me generate a readme file for my project. It's a new project, please nothing about "how to contribute" or "maintainers" etc. The real secret here is, I'm going to use Cursor to ingest this README into its context window to help guide it as it's helping me write the project.

So let's think through this. I'll tell you the basic technical requirements I want to use, the steps I want to take in iterating towards it, and you'll ask me clarifying questions along the way before we write the readme.

The end goal is: this is a project which is some kind of UI app which is meant to help high schoolers learn to code. The approach I find useful when learning concepts is I ask you, Claude to generate hands-on tutorials for me. Hands on is the ultimate key: I type it all myself, I run it all myself.

The chat bot will have all sorts of
